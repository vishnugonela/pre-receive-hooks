# pre-receive-hooks

This repository hosts the **pre-receive** hooks for use on this GitHub Enterprise instance.

## What is a pre-receive hook?

A **hook** in a repository is a script that executes before or after events such as commit, push and receive.

**GitHub Enterprise (GHE)** allows the usage of **pre-receive hooks** in its Git repositories with the help of its Site Administrators. This repository is used to host the pre-receive hook scripts and is maintained by the GHE Site Administrator team _(**Support** link is located at the bottom of this page)_.



The RnD-IT GHE team are currently evaluating the needs, concerns, effort, and viability of pre-receive-hooks within the GHE@HPE site.  At this time, there are strict guidelines that must be followed for proposing and implementing new pre-receive-hooks.  These guidelines are included in this [CONTRIBUTE.md](https://github.hpe.com/RnDIT-SWET/pre-receive-hooks/blob/POC/CONTRIBUTE.md).  Please note, these guidelines can be modified at any time.  Be sure to review it before all new proposals/Pull Requests.
