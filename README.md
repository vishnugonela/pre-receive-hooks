# pre-receive-hooks

## Proof of Concept  
The RnD-IT GHE team are currently evaluating the needs, concerns, effort, and viability of pre-receive-hooks within the GHE@HPE site.  At this time, there are strict guidelines that must be followed for proposing and implementing new pre-receive-hooks.  These guidelines are included in this [CONTRIBUTE.md](https://github.hpe.com/RnDIT-SWET/pre-receive-hooks/blob/POC/CONTRIBUTE.md).  Please note, these guidelines can be modified at any time.  Be sure to review it before all new proposals/Pull Requests.
